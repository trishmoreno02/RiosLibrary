Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry\'s parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old', 'Fiction'),
(2, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'J. K. Rowling', 'Fantasy', 'The plot follows Harry\'s second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school\'s corridors warn that the \"Chamber of Secrets\" has been opened and that the \"heir of Slytherin\" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks which leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks', 'Fiction'),
(3, 'Twilight', 'Stephanie Meyer', 'Romance', 'It is the first book in the Twilight series, and introduces seventeen-year-old Isabella \"Bella\" Swan, who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington. She is endangered after falling in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire.', 'Fiction'),
(4, 'The Lord of the Rings', 'J. R. R. Tolkien', 'Fantasy', 'The title of the novel refers to the story\'s main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,[a] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise \"Sam\" Gamgee, Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took, but also the hobbits\' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard.', 'Fiction'),
(5, 'A Brief History of Time', 'Stephen Hawking', 'Non-Fiction', 'In A Brief History of Time, Hawking writes in non-technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics. He talks about basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. He discusses two major theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the universe. Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the universe in a coherent manner.', 'Circulation'),
(6, 'A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning', 'Lemony Snicket', 'Comedy', 'The Bad Beginning is the first novel of the children\'s novel series A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. The novel tells the story of three children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, who become orphans following a fire and are sent to live with Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance.', 'Children\'s Section'),
(7, 'It', 'Stephen King', 'Horror', 'The novel is told through narratives alternating between two periods, and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood, the ugliness lurking behind a fa√ßade of small-town quaintness, and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice.', 'Fiction');
